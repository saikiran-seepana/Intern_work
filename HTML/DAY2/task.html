					People often think it is extremely difficult to make a website. That is not the case! Everyone can learn how to make a website. And if you read on, you will have made one in just one hour.
				</p>
				<p>
					Others believe - just as mistakenly - that expensive and advanced software is needed to make websites. It is true that there are lots of different programs that claim they can create a website for you. Some come closer than others. But if you want it done right, you must do it yourself. Fortunately, it is simple and free and you already have all the software you need.

				</p>
				<p>
					The aim of this tutorial is to give you an easy, yet thorough and correct introduction to how to make websites. The tutorial starts from scratch and requires absolutely no prior knowledge of programming.
				</p>
				<p>
					The tutorial cannot show you everything. So some engagement and a will to experiment are required. But don't worry - learning how to make websites is a lot of fun and gives a tremendous amount of satisfaction when you get it right.
				</p>
				<p>
					How you choose to use the tutorial is up to you. But we suggest you read only two or three lessons a day and take time to experiment with the new things you learn in each lesson.
				</p>
				<p>
					Okay, enough talk. Let's get started!

				<h2 align="center">Lesson 1 : Let's get started</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					In this first lesson, you will get a brief presentation of the tools you need to make a website.
				</p>
				<h3>What is needed?</h3>
				<p>
					Most likely you already have everything you need.
				</p>
				<p>
					You have a "browser". A browser is the program that makes it possible to browse and open websites. Right now you are looking at this page in your browser.
				</p>
				<p>
					It is not important which browser you use. The most common is Microsoft Internet Explorer. But there are others such as Opera and Mozilla Firefox and they can all be used.
				</p>
				<p>
					You might have heard about, or even used, programs such as Microsoft FrontPage, Macromedia Dreamweaver or even Microsoft Word, which can - or claim that they can - create websites for you. Forget these programs for now! They are not of any help to you when learning how to code your own website.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead, you need a simple text editor. If you are using Windows you can use Notepad, which is usually found in the start menu under Programs in Accessories:
				</p>
				<img src="">
				<p>
					If you are not using Windows, you can use a similar simple text editor. For example, Pico (Linux) or TextEdit (Mac).
				</p>
				<p>
					Notepad is a very basic text editing program which is excellent for coding because it does not interfere with what you are typing. It gives you complete control. The problem with many of the programs that claim they can create websites is that they have a lot of standard functions, which you can choose from. The downside is that, everything needs to fit into these standard functions. Thus, this type of programs often cannot create a website exactly as you want it. Or - even more annoyingly - they make changes to your hand-written code. With Notepad or other simple text editors, you only have yourself to thank for your successes and errors.
				</p>
				<p>
					A browser and Notepad (or a similar simple text editor) are all you need to go through this tutorial and make your own websites.
				</p>
				<h3>Do I need to be online?</h3>
				<p>
					You do not need to be connected to the Internet - neither while reading this tutorial, nor while making your websites.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you want to avoid being online while reading this tutorial, you can either print it out or simply disconnect from the Internet while reading on screen. You can make the website on your computer's hard disk and upload it to the Internet when it is finished.
				</p>
				<h3>What's next?</h3>
				<p>
					Go to the next lesson and read about HTML before the fun really starts in Lesson 3.

				<h2 align="center">Lesson 2 : What is HTML?</h2>
				<hr>
				<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
				<p></p>
				<p></p>
				<img src="">
				<p></p>
				<h3>What can I use HTML for?</h3>
				<p>
					If you want to make websites, there is no way around HTML. Even if you're using a program to create websites, such as Dreamweaver, a basic knowledge of HTML can make life a lot simpler and your website a lot better. The good news is that HTML is easy to learn and use. In just two lessons from now you will have learned how to make your first website.
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>HTML is used to make websites. It is as simple as that!</b>
				</p>
				<h3>Okay, but what does H-T-M-L stand for?</h3>
				<p>
					HTML is an abbreviation of "HyperText Mark-up Language" - which is already more than you need to know at this stage. However, for the sake of good order, let us explain in greater detail.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Hper </b>is the opposite of linear. In the good old days - when a mouse was something the cat chased - computer programs ran linearly: when the program had executed one action it went to the next line and after that, the next line and so on. But HTML is different - you can go wherever you want and whenever you want. For example, it is not necessary to visit MSN.com before you visit HTML.net.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Text </b>is self-explanatory.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Mark-up </b>is what you do with the text. You are marking up the text the same way you do in a text editing program with headings, bullets and bold text and so on.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Language </b>is what HTML is. It uses many English words.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					In this tutorial you will learn so-called XHTML (Extensible HyperText Mark-up Language) which, in short, is a new and more well-structured way of writing HTML.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now you know what HTML (and XHTML) stands for let's get started with what it is all about: making websites.
				</p>

				<br>
				<h2 align="center">Lesson 3 : Elements and Tags?</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					You are now ready to learn the essence of HTML: elements.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elements give structure to a HTML document and tells the browser how you want your website to be presented. Generally elements consists of a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
				</p>
				<h3>"Tags"?</h3>
				<p>
					Tags are labels you use to mark up the begining and end of an element.
				</p>
				<p>
					All tags have the same format: they begin with a less-than sign "<" and end with a greater-than sign ">".
				</p>
				<p>
					Generally speaking, there are two kinds of tags - opening tags: &lthtml&gt and closing tags: &lt/html&gt. The only difference between an opening tag and a closing tag is the forward slash "/". You label content by putting it between an opening tag and a closing tag.
				</p>
				<p>
					HTML is all about elements. To learn HTML is to learn and use different tags.
				</p>
				<h3>Can you show me some examples?</h3>
				<p>
					Okay, the element em emphasis text. All text between the opening tag &ltem> and the closing tag &lt/em> is emphasised in the browser. ("em" is short for "emphasis".)
				</p>
				<h4>Example 1:</h4>
				<xmp>	<em>Emphasised text.</em></xmp>
				<p>
					Will look like this in the browser:
				</p>
				Emphasised text.
				<p>
					The elements h1, h2, h3, h4, h5 and h6 is used to make headings (h stands for "heading"), where h1 is the first level and normally the largest text, h2 is the second level and normally slightly smaller text, and h6 is the sixth and last in the hierarchy of headings and normally the smallest text.
				</p>
				<h4>Example 2:</h4><xmp>	<h1>This is a heading</h1>
	<h2>This is a subheading</h2>
</xmp>
				<p>Will look like this in the browser:</p>
				<h1>This is a heading</h1>
				<h2>This is a subheading</h2>
				<h3>So, I always need an opening tag and a closing tag?</h3>
				<p>
					As they say, there's an exception to every rule and in HTML the exception is that there are a few elements which both open and close in the same tag. These so-called empty elements are not connected to a specific passage in the text but rather are isolated labels, for example, a line break which looks like this: &ltbr />.
				</p>
				<h3>Should tags be typed in uppercase or lowercase?</h3>
				<p>
					Most browsers might not care if you type your tags in upper, lower or mixed cases. &ltHTML>, &lthtml> or &ltHtMl> will normally give the same result. However, the correct way is to type tags in lowercase. So get into the habit of writing your tags in lowercase.
				</p>
				<h3>Where do I put all these tags?</h3>
				<p>
					You type your tags in an HTML document. A website contains one or more HTML documents. When you surf the Web, you merely open different HTML documents.

				<h2 align="center">Lesson 4 : Create your first website</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					With what you learned in the previous lessons, you are now only minutes away from making your first website.
				</p>
				<h3>How?</h3>
				<p>
					In Lesson 1 we looked at what is needed to make a website: a browser and Notepad (or similar text editor). Since you are reading this, you most likely already have your browser open. The only thing you need to do is to open an extra browser window (open the browser one more time) so you can read this tutorial and see your new website at the same time.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also, open Notepad (in Accessories under Programs in the Start menu):
				</p>
				<img src="">
				<h3>What can I do?</h3>
				<p>
					Let us start with something simple. How about a page that says: "Hurrah! This is my first website." Read on and you'll find out how simple it is.
				</p>
				<p>
					HTML is simple and logical. The browser reads HTML like you read English: from the top down and from left to right. Thus, an simple HTML document begins with what should come first and ends with what should come last.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first thing you need to do is to tell the browser that you will "talk" to it in the language HTML. This is done with the tag &lthtml> (no surprises there). So before you do anything else type "&lthtml>" in the first line of your document in Notepad
				</p>
				<p>
					The first thing you need to do is to tell the browser that you will "talk" to it in the language HTML. This is done with the tag &lthtml> (no surprises there). So before you do anything else type "&lthtml>" in the first line of your document in Notepad.
				</p>
				<p>
					As you may recall from the previous lessons, &lthtml> is an opening tag and must be closed with a closing tag when you are finished typing HTML. So to make sure you don't forget the HTML close tag now type "&lt/html>" a couple of lines down and write the rest of the document between &lthtml> and &l/html>.
				</p>
				<p>
					The next thing your document needs is a "head", which provides information about your document, and a "body", which is the content of the document. Since HTML is nothing if not logical, the head (&lthead> and &lt/head>) is on top of the body (&ltbody> and &lt/body>).
				</p>
				<p>
					Your document should now look like this:
				</p><xmp>	<html>

	<head>	
	</head>	

	<body>	
	</body>	

	</html></xmp>
				<p>
					Note how we structured the tags with new lines (using the Enter key) as well as indents (using the Tab key). In principle, it does not matter how you structure your HTML document. But to help you, and others reading your coding, to keep an overview, it is strongly recommended that you structure your HTML in a neat way with line breaks and indents, like the above example.
				</p>
				<p>
					If your document looks like the above example, you have made your first website - a particularly boring website and probably not what you dreamt of when you started this tutorial but still some sort of a website. What you have made will be the basic template for all your future HTML documents.
				</p>
				<h3>So far so good, but how do I add content to my website?</h3>
				<p>
					As you learnt earlier, your HTML document has two parts: a head and a body. In the head section you write information about the page, while the body contains the information that constitutes the page.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, if you want to give the page a title which will appear in the top bar of the browser, it should be done in the "head" section. The element used for a title is title. I.e. write the title of the page between the opening tag &lttitle> and the closing tag &lt/title>:
				</p>
				<xmp></xmp>
				<p>
					Note that this title will not appear on the page itself. Anything you want to appear on the page is content and must therefore be added between the "body" tags.
				</p>
				<xmp></xmp>
				<p>
					As promised, we want the page to say "Hurrah! This is my first website." This is the text that we want to communicate and it therefore belongs in the body section. So in the body section, type the following:
				</p>
				<xmp></xmp>
				<p>
					The p in <p> is short for "paragraph" which is exactly what it is - a text paragraph.Your HTML document should now look like this:
				</p>
				<xmp></xmp>
				<p>
					Next all you have to do is to save it to your hard drive and then open it in your browser:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						In Notepad choose "Save as..." under "File" in the top menu.
					</li>
					<li>
						Choose "All Files" in the "Save as type" box. This is very important - otherwise, you save it as a text document and not as an HTML document.
					</li>
					<li>
						Now save your document as "page1.htm" (the ending ".htm" indicates that it is an HTML document. ".html" gives the same result. I always use ".htm", but you can choose whichever of the two extensions you prefer). It doesn't matter where you save the document on your hard drive - as long as you remember where you saved it so you can find it again.
					</li>
					<img src="">
					Now go to browser:
					<li>
						In the top menu choose "Open" under "File" (or press CTRL+O).
					</li>
					<li>
						Click "Browse" in the box that appears.
					</li>
					<li>
						Now find your HTML document and click "Open".
					</li>
					<img src="">
				</ul>
				<p>
					If you absolutely want the whole world to see your masterpiece right away, you can jump to Lesson 13 and learn how to upload your page to the Internet. Otherwise, be patient and read on. The fun has just begun.

				<h2 align="center">Lesson 5 : What have you learned so far?</h2>
				<hr>
				<h4>Always start with the basic template we made in the previous lesson:</h4>
				<p>
					In the head section, always write a title: &lttitle>The title of your page&lt/title>. Notice how the title will be shown in the upper left corner of your browser:&lthtml>
				</p>
				<xmp>	<head>
	  <title></title>
	  </head>

	  <body>
	  </body>

	</html></xmp>
				<p>In the head section, always write a title: &lttitle>The title of your page&lt/title>. Notice how the title will be shown in the upper left corner of your browser:
				</p>
				<img src="http://html.net/tutorials/html/title.png">
				<p>
					The title is especially important because it is used by search engines (such as Google) to index your website and is shown in the search results.
				</p>
				<img src="http://html.net/tutorials/html/google.png">
				<p>
					In the body section, you write the actual content of the page. You already know some of the most important elements:
				</p>
				<xmp>	<p>Is used for paragraphs.</p>
	<em>Emphasis text.</em>
	<h1>Heading</h1>
	<h2>Subhead</h2>
	<h3>Sub-subhead</h3> </xmp>
				<p></p>
				<h3>What is that supposed to mean?</h3>
				<p>
					Nobody becomes a good website creator by learning the examples in this tutorial. What you get in this tutorial is simply a basic understanding of the building blocks - to become good you must use the building blocks in new and creative ways.So, get out in the deep water and stand on your own two feet... Okay, maybe not. But give it a go and experiment with what you have learned.
				</p>
				<h3>So what's next?</h3>
				<p>
					Try to create a few pages yourself. For instance, make a page with a title, a heading, some text, a subhead and some more text. It is perfectly okay to look in the tutorial while you make your first pages. But later, see if you can do it on your own - without looking.

				<h2 align="center">Lesson 6 : A few more elements</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Did you manage to make a few pages on your own? If not, here is an example:
				</p>
				<xmp>	<html>

	  <head>
	  <title>My website</title>
	  </head>

	  <body>
	  <h1>A Heading</h1>
	  <p>text, text text, text</p>
	  <h2>Subhead</h2>
	  <p>text, text text, text</p>
	  </body>
	  
	</html></xmp>
				<h3>Now what?</h3>
				<p>
					Now it is time to learn seven new elements.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the same way you emphasise the text by putting it between the openning tag &ltem> and the closing tag &lt/em>, you can give stronger emphasis by using the openning tag &ltstrong> and the closing tag &lt/strong>.
				</p>
				<h4>Example :</h4>
				<xmp>	<strong>Stronger emphasis.</strong></xmp>
				Will look like this in the browser:<br>
				<strong>Stronger emphasis.</strong>
				<h4>Example :</h4>
				<xmp>	<small>This should be in small.</small></xmp>
				Will look like this in the browser:<br>
				<small>This should be in small.</small>
				<h3>Can I use several elements at the same time?</h3>
				<p>
					You can easily use several elements at the same time as long as you avoid overlapping elements. This is best illustrated by an example:
				</p>
				<h4>Example 3:</h4>
				<p>
					If you want to emphasise small text, it must be done like this:
				</p>
				<xmp>	<em><small>Emphasised small text</small></em></xmp>
				<p>
					And NOT like this
				</p>
				<xmp>	<em><small>Emphasise small text</em></small></xmp>
				<p>
					The difference is that in the first example, we closed the tag we first opened last. This way we avoid confusing both ourselves and the browser.
				</p>
				<h3>More elements!</h3>
				<p>
					As mentioned in Lesson 3 there are elements which are opened and closed in the same tag. These so-called empty elements are not connected to a specific passage in the text but rather are isolated labels. An example of such a tag is <br /> which creates a forced line break:
				</p>
				<h4>Example 4:</h4>
				<xmp>	Some text<br /> and some more text in a new line</xmp>
				Will look like this in the browser.<br>
				Some text<br /> and some more text in a new line<br>
				<p>
					Notice that the tag is written as a contraction of an opening and closing tag with an empty space and a forward slash at the end: &ltbr />.Another element that is opened and closed in the same tag is &lthr /> which is used to draw a horizontal line ("hr" stands for "horizontal rule"):
				</p>

				<h4>Example 5:</h4>
				<xmp>	<hr /></xmp>
				Will look like this in the browser.
				<br><hr />
				<p>
					Examples of elements that needs both an opening tag and a closing tag - as most elements do - is ul, ol and li. These elements are used when you want to make lists.ul is short for "unordered list" and inserts bullets for each list item. ol is short for "ordered list" and numbers each list item. To make items in the list use the li tag ("list item"). Confused? See the examples:
				</p>
				<h4>Example 6:</h4>
				<xmp>	<ol>
	  <li>First list item</li>
	  <li>Second list item</li>
	</ol></xmp>
				
				Will look like this in the browser.<br>
				<ol>
	 				<li>First list item</li>
					 <li>Second list item</li>
				</ol>
				<h3>Phew! Is that all?</h3>
				<p>
					That is all for now. Again, experiment and make your own pages using some of the seven new elements you learned in this lesson:
				</p>
				<xmp>	<strong>Stronger emphasis</strong>
	<small>Small text</small>
	<br /> Line shift
	<hr /> Horizontal line
	<ul>List</ul>
	<ol>Ordered list</ol>
	<li>List item</li></xmp>

		<div id="7">
			<fieldset>
				<br>
				<h2 align="center">Lesson 7 : Attributes</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					You can add attributes to a number of elements.
				</p>
				<h3>What is an attribute?</h3>
				<p>
					As you probably remember, elements give structure to a HTML document and tells the browser how you want your website to be presented (for example, <br /> informs the browser to make a line break). In some elements you can add more information. Such additional information is called an attribute.
				</p>
				<h4>Example 1:</h4>
				<xmp>	<h2 style="background-color:#ff0000;">My friendship with HTML</h2></xmp>
				<br>
				<p>
					Attributes are always written within a start tag and are followed by an equals sign and the attribute details written between inverted commas. The semicolon after the attribute is for separating different style commands. We will get back to that later.
				</p>
				<h3>What is the catch?</h3>
				<p>
					There are many different attributes. The first one you will learn is style. With the style attribute you can add layout to your website. For instance a background colour:
				</p>
				<h4>Example 2:</h4>
				<xmp>	<html>
	  
	  <head>
	  </head>

	  <body style="background-color:#ff0000;">
	  </body>

	</html></xmp>
				<br>
				<p>
					will show a completely red page in the browser - go ahead and see for yourself. We will explain in greater detail how the colour system works in a few moments.Note that some tags and attributes use US spelling i.e. color instead of colour. It is important that you are careful to use the same spelling as we use in the examples in this tutorial - otherwise, browsers will not be able to understand your codes. Also, don't forget to always close the inverted commas (quotation marks) after an attribute.
				</p>
				<h3>How did the page become red?</h3>
				<p>
					n the above example, we asked for the background colour with the code "#ff0000". This is the colour code for red using so called hexadecimal numbers (HEX). Each colour has its own hexadecimal number. Here are some examples:
				</p>
				<p>
					White: #ffffff<br>
					Black: #000000 (zeros)<br>
					Red: #ff0000<br>
					Blue: #0000ff<br>
					Green: #00ff00<br>
					Yellow: #ffff00

				<h4>Example 3:</h4>
				<xmp>	Enough about colours. Let's get back to the attributes.

</xmp>
				<br>
				<p>
					
				</p>
				<h3>Which elements can use attributes?</h3>

				<h4>Different attributes can be applied to most elements.</h4>
				<p>
					You will often use attributes in tags such as the body tag while you will rarely use attributes in, for example, a br tag since a line break normally is a line break without any parameters to adjust.
				</p>
				<p>
					Just as there are many different elements, so there are many different attributes. Some attributes are tailor made for one particular element while others can be used for many different element. And vice versa: some elements can only contain one kind of attribute while others can contain many.
				</p>
				<p>
					It may sound a bit confusing but once you get acquainted with the different attributes it is actually very logical and you will soon see how easy they are to use and how many possibilities they provide.
				</p>
				<p>
					This tutorial will introduce you to the most important attributes.
				</p>
				<h3>Exactly what parts does an element consist of?</h3>
				<p>
					Generally an elements consist of a start tag with or without one or more attributes, some content and an end tag. Simple as that. See the illustration below.

				<h2 align="center">Lesson 8 : Links</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					In this lesson, you will learn how to make links between pages.
				</p>
				<h3>What do I need to make a link?</h3>
				<p>
					To make links, you use what you always use when coding HTML: an element. A simple element with one attribute and you will be able to link to anything and everything. Here is an example of what a link to HTML.net could look like:
				</p>
				<h4>Example 1:</h4>
				<xmp>	<a href="http://www.html.net/">Here is a link to HTML.net</a></xmp><br>
				Would look like this in the browser:
				<a href="http://www.html.net/">Here is a link to HTML.net</a><br>
				<p>
					The element a stands for "anchor". And the attribute href is short for "hypertext reference", which specifies where the link leads to - typically an address on the internet or a file name.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the above example the attribute href has the value "http://www.html.net", which is the full address of HTML.net and is called a URL (Uniform Resource Locator). Note that "http://" must always be included in URLs. The sentence "Here is a link to HTML.net" is the text that is shown in the browser as the link. Remember to close the element with an &lt/a>.
				</p>
				<h3>What about links between my own pages?</h3>
				<p>
					If you want to make a link between pages on the same website, you do not need to spell out the entire address (URL) for the document. For example, if you have made two pages (let us call them page1.htm and page2.htm) and saved them in the same folder you can make a link from one page to the other by only typing the name of the file in the link. Under such circumstances a link from page1.htm to page2.htm could look like this:
				</p>
				<h4>Example 2:</h4>
				<xmp>	<a href="page2.htm">Click here to go to page 2</a></xmp><br>
				<p>
					If page 2 were placed in a subfolder (named "subfolder"), the link could look like this:
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Example 3:</h4>
				<xmp>	<a href="subfolder/page2.htm">Click here to go to page 2</a></xmp><br>
				<p>
					The other way around, a link from page 2 (in the subfolder) to page 1 would look like this:
				</p>
				<br>
				<h4>Example 4:</h4>
				<xmp>	<a href="../page1.htm">A link to page 1</a></xmp><br>
				<p>
					"../" points to the folder one level up from position of the file from which the link is made. Following the same system, you can also point two (or more) folders up by writing "../../".Did you understand the system? Alternatively, you can always type the complete address for the file (URL).
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>What about internal links within a page?</h3>
				<p>
					You can also create internal links within a page - for example a table of contents at the top with links to each chapter below. All you need to use is a very useful attribute called id (identification) and the symbol "#".
				</p>
				<p>
					Use the id attribute to mark the element to which you want to link. For example:
				</p>
				<xmp>	<h1 id="heading1">heading 1</h1></xmp>
				<br>
				<p>
					You can now create a link to that element by using "#" in the link attribute. The "#" must be followed by the id of the tag you want to link to. For example:
				</p>
				<xmp>	<a href="#heading1">Link to heading 1</a></xmp>

				<h2 align="center">Lesson 9 : Images</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Wouldn't it be great if you could have an image of actor stylish star allu arjun right in the centre of your page?
				</p>
				<h3>That sounds like a bit of a challenge...</h3>
				<p>Maybe, but in fact it is pretty easy to do. All you need is an element:</p>
				<h4>Example 1 :</h4>
				<xmp>	<img src="david.jpg" alt="David" /></xmp>
				Will look like this in browser.<br>
				<img src="david.jpg" alt="David"/>
				<p>
					All you need do is first tell the browser that you want to insert an image (img) and then where it is located (src, short for "source"). Do you get the picture?Notice how the img element is opened and closed using the same tag. Like the &ltbr /> tag, it is not tied to a piece of text.
				</p>
				<p>
					"david.jpg" is the name of the image file you want to insert in your page. ".jpg" is the file type of the image. Just like the extension ".htm" shows that a file is an HTML document, ".jpg" tells the browser that a file is a picture. There are three different types of image file types you can insert into your pages:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>GIF (Graphics Interchange Format)</li>
					<li>JPG / JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group)</li>
					<li>PNG (Portable Network Graphics)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					GIF images are usually best for graphics and drawings, while JPEG images are usually better for photographs. This is for two reasons: first, GIF images only consist of 256 colours, while JPEG images comprise of millions of colours and second, the GIF format is better at compressing simple images, than the JPEG format which is optimized for more complex images. The better the compression, the smaller the size of the image file, the faster your page will load. As you probably know from your own experience, unnecessarily 'heavy' pages can be extremely annoying for the user
				</p>
				<p>
					Traditionally, the GIF and JPEG formats have been the two dominant image types, but lately, the PNG format has become more and more popular (primarily at the expense of the GIF format). The PNG format contains in many ways the best of both the JPEG and GIF format: millions of colours and effective compressing.

				<h2 align="center">Lesson 10 : Tables</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					Tables are used when you need to show "tabular data" i.e. information that is logically presented in rows and columns.
				</p>
				<h3>Is it difficult?</h3>
				<p>
					Building tables in HTML may at first seem complicated but if you keep cool and watch your step, it is actually strictly logical - just like everything else in HTML.
				</p>
				<h4>Example : 1</h4>
				<xmp>	<table>
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 1</td>
		<td>Cell 2</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 3</td>
		<td>Cell 4</td>
	  </tr>
	</table></xmp>
				Will look like this in browser
				<table>
				  	<tr>
						<td>Cell 1</td>
						<td>Cell 2</td>
					</tr>
				 	<tr>
						<td>Cell 3</td>
						<td>Cell 4</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<h3>What's the difference between &lttr> and &lttd>?</h3>
				<p>
					As you will see from the above example, this is probably the most complicated HTML example we have given you so far. Let's break it down and explain the different tags:
				</p>
				<h4>3 different elements are used to insert tables:</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>	
						The opening tag &lttable> and the closing tag &lt/table> starts and ends the table. Logical.
					</li>
					<li>	
						&lttr> stands for "table row" and starts and ends horizontal rows. Still logical.
					</li>
					<li>	
						&lttd> is short for "table data". This tag starts and ends each cell in the rows of your table. All simple and logical.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Here is what happens in Example 1: the table starts with a <table>, followed by a <tr>, which indicates the beginning of a new row. Two cells are inserted in this row: <td>Cell 1</td> and <td>Cell 2</td>. The row is hereafter closed with a </tr> and a new row <tr> begins immediately after. The new row also contains two cells. The table is closed with </table>.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the above example, the table has two rows and two columns. However, a table can have an unlimited number of rows and columns.
				</p>
				<h4>Example : 2</h4>
				<xmp>	<table>
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 1</td>
		<td>Cell 2</td>
		<td>Cell 3</td>
		<td>Cell 4</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 5</td>
		<td>Cell 6</td>
		<td>Cell 7</td>
		<td>Cell 8</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 9</td>
		<td>Cell 10</td>
		<td>Cell 11</td>
		<td>Cell 12</td>
	  </tr>
	</table></xmp>
				Will look like this in browser
				<table>
					<tr>
						<td>Cell 1</td>
						<td>Cell 2</td>
						<td>Cell 3</td>
						<td>Cell 4</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cell 5</td>
						<td>Cell 6</td>
						<td>Cell 7</td>
						<td>Cell 8</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cell 9</td>
						<td>Cell 10</td>
						<td>Cell 11</td>
						<td>Cell 12</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<h3>Are there any attributes?</h3>
				<p>
					Of course there are attributes. For example, the border attribute is used to specify the thickness of the border around your table:
				</p>
				<h4>Example : 3</h4>
				<xmp>	<table border="1">
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 1</td>
		<td>Cell 2</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 3</td>
		<td>Cell 4</td>
	  </tr>
	</table></xmp>
				Will look like this in browser
				<table border="1">
					<tr>
						<td>Cell 1</td>
						<td>Cell 2</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cell 3</td>
						<td>Cell 4</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<h3>What can I insert in my tables?</h3>
				<p>
					Theoretically, you can insert anything in tables: text, links and images... BUT tables are meant for presenting tabular data (i.e. data which can be meaningfully presented in columns and rows) so refrain from putting things into tables simply because you want them to be placed next to each other.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the old days on the Internet - i.e. a few years ago - tables were often used as a layout tool. But if you want to control the presentation of texts and images there is a much cooler way to do it (hint: CSS). But more about that later.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, put what you just learned to practice and design a number of tables in different sizes, with different attributes and content. This should keep you busy for hours.

				<h2 align="center">Lesson 11 : More about tables</h2>
				<hr>
				<p>
					The title "More about tables" may sound a bit boring. But look at the positive side, when you master tables, there is absolutely nothing about HTML that will knock you out.
				</p>
				<h3>What is left then?</h3>
				<p>
					The two attributes colspan and rowspan are used when you want to create fancy tables.
				</p>
				<p>
					Colspan is short for "column span". Colspan is used in the &lttd> tag to specify how many columns the cell should span:
				</p>
				<h4>Example  :</h4>
				<xmp><table border="1">
	  <tr>
		<td colspan="3">Cell 1</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 2</td>
		<td>Cell 3</td>
		<td>Cell 4</td>
	  </tr>
	</table></xmp>
				Will look like this in browser.
				<table border="1">
	  				<tr>
						<td colspan="3">Cell 1</td>
	 				 </tr>
	  				<tr>
						<td>Cell 2</td>
						<td>Cell 3</td>
						<td>Cell 4</td>
	 				 </tr>
				</table>
				<h4>Example  :</h4>
				<xmp>	<table border="1">
	  <tr>
		<td colspan="2">Cell 1</td>
		<td>Cell 2</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 3</td>
		<td>Cell 4</td>
		<td>Cell 5</td>
	  </tr>
	</table></xmp>
				Will look like this in browser.
				<table border="1">
					<tr>
						<td colspan="2">Cell 1</td>
						<td>Cell 2</td>
				 	</tr>
				  	<tr>
						<td>Cell 3</td>
						<td>Cell 4</td>
						<td>Cell 5</td>
				 	</tr>
				</table>
				<h3>What about rowspan?</h3>
				<p>
					As you might already have guessed, rowspan specifies how many rows a cell should span over:
				</p>
				<h4>Example  :</h4>
				<xmp>	<table border="1">
	  <tr>
		<td rowspan="3">Cell 1</td>
		<td>Cell 2</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 3</td>
	  </tr>
	  <tr>
		<td>Cell 4</td>
	  </tr>
	</table></xmp>
				Will look like this in browser.
				<table border="1">
					<tr>
						<td rowspan="3">Cell 1</td>
						<td>Cell 2</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cell 3</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Cell 4</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					In the example above rowspan is set to "3" in Cell 1. This specifies that the cell must span over 3 rows (its own row plus an additional two). Cell 1 and Cell 2 are thereby in the same row, while Cell 3 and Cell 4 form two independent rows.
				</p>
				<p>
					Confused? Well, it is not uncomplicated and it is easy to lose track. Therefore, it might be a good idea to draw the table on a piece of paper before you begin with the HTML.
				</p>
				<p>
					Not confused? Then go ahead and create a couple of tables with both colspan and rowspan on your own.
